# Visualizing the RESOLVE/ECO dataset

### 2016 January

I downloaded the public Environmental COntext data release 1 (ECO DR1) catalog from the [RESOLVE/ECO website](https://resolve.astro.unc.edu/) ([Moffett et al. 2015](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...812...89M)). The catalog contains archival data of a volume-limited sample of galaxies in the nearby universe. I had downloaded the catalog during the 227th AAS meeting, and on the plane ride back, I decided to make some pretty plots (and familiarize myself with the pandas and seaborn Python packages).
